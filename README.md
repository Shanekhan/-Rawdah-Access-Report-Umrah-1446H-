# 🕋 Rawdah Access Report – Umrah 1446H  
**Data Analytics Case Study by Shanzay Khan**

## 📌 Project Summary
A deep-dive analysis into Rawdah Al-Sharifah access during the 1446H Umrah season. Despite 13M Rawdah visits, digital-only permit systems excluded millions — especially seniors and kids —from participating.

This report blends:
- 📊 Official visa & pilgrim data
- 💬 Firsthand user complaints (Reddit, YouTube, app reviews)
- 👵🧒 Age-based access analysis
- 🧠 Actionable policy & UX recommendations

## ⚙️ Tools & Methods
- **Excel** – data cleaning, pivot analysis, and charting  
- **Canva** – report design and visual storytelling  
- **Reddit/YouTube** – qualitative data scraping  
- **Manual estimation** – when no clean dataset existed  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Only a fraction of 10.47M pilgrims accessed Rawdah  
- Peak demand (Rajab–Sha’ban) overwhelmed digital systems  
- 22% of pilgrims were 65+ or under 14 — groups most affected  
- User complaints flagged system bugs, login failures, and zero offline support  

## ✅ Recommendations
- Introduce **offline permit kiosks**  
- Enable **agent-assisted bookings**  
- Reserve **walk-in slots** for seniors (65+)  
- Add **“Elder Mode”** to the Nusuk app (simplified UI, audio guidance)  
- Launch a **WhatsApp or phone support line**
